problem 2 
/*Programming languages have some conditional / decision-making statements that execute when some specific condition is fulfilled.
Switch-case is one of the ways  implement them.

In a menu-driven program, the user is given a set of choices of things to do (the menu) and then is asked to select a menu item.

There are 2 choices in the menu


Choice 1 is to find the area of a circle having radius 'r'.

Choice 2 is to find the area of a rectangle having dimensions 'l' and 'b'.

You are given the choice 'ch' and an array 'a'*/


code

double areaSwitchCase(int ch, vector<double> a) {
	// Write your code here
	if(ch==1){ 
		double r=a[0];
		double  area=3.14159265359 *r*r;
		return area;
	}
	 if (ch==2){ 
		int l=a[0];
		int b=a[1];
		int area= l*b;
		return area;
	}
}
